======  TESTING using python ( PYTEST ) ==========

1. All scripts written under Scripts folder
	Every feature has a subfolder within this ex : API ( has seperate folder)

	Logging function
	Getconfig - function to read & get data from config.ini
4. All files required for data like CSV/Excel etc are placed in the utilities folder itself
5. Marks Used: ( for grouping)
	@pytest.mark.APITests  --- for all API tests
	@pytest.mark.httpGET   --- for all GET method
	@pytest.mark.httpWithAuth  -- Auth cases
