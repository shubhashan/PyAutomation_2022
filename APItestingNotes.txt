API testing automation


MArks used:

@pytest.mark.httpGET
@pytest.mark.httpPOST
@pytest.mark.httpPUT
@pytest.mark.APITests

Practice test scripts: ( in pytest format ) ---- no logging / fixtures used

APIValidationsGET.py
APIValidationsPOST.py
APIValidationsPUT.py

In PUT we need to specify all the values along with the one we need to update, whereas in 
PUT - updates/replaces only if record exists. If doesnt exist it will create

PATCH we need to send only the key=value that needs to  be updated.
